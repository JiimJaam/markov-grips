RIDERS OF THE LUPUS HOUR.
EYE ON PALM, TIME IS GONE.
MOONLIGHT DRAWN, FLY TILL DAWN.
SACRIFICE TO RISE BEYOND.
DEEP INSIDE THE VIOLENT CALM OF THE COMING STORM.
IN BLOOD SWORN TO GLORIFY AND FOR LIFE ADORN.
WITH ALL THAT DIES TO BECOME UNBORN.
I CLOSE MY EYES AND SEIZE IT.
I CLENCH MY FISTS AND BEAT IT.
I LIGHT MY TORCH AND BURN IT.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
I CLOSE MY EYES AND SEIZE IT.
I CLENCH MY FISTS AND BEAT IT.
I LIGHT MY TORCH AND BURN IT.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
IN THE TIME BEFORE TIME EYES 'BOVE WHICH HORNS.
CURVE LIKE PSYCHOTROPIC SCYTHES.
AND SMELL OF TORN FLESH BLED DRY.
BY HELL SWARMS OF PESTIS FLIES.
VOMITING FORTH FLAMES LIT BY.
AN OLDER THAN ANCIENT FORCE.
THAT SLAYS THIS LIFE WITH NO REMORSE.
THE SPIRAL STORM OF FLAMES INSIDE.
THE TORCH I RAISE, THE FORCE I RIDE.
FEEL MY VESSEL GO UP IN FLAMES.
FLESH TORCH LIT BY THEE UNNAMED.
DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE SOURCE.
VESTMENT OF UNNATURAL FORCE.
FOREVER BURNING BLACK TORCH.
WISDOM OF THE OLD AND TRUE.
POSSESSED BY THE CHOSEN FEW.
SHINING TO REVEAL THE WAYS.
OF A DARKNESS THAT PERVADES.
ALL THAT IS AND EVER WAS.
INFERNO OF WITCHES' BLOOD.
WORSHIP IS NOT ON BENDED KNEE.
NATURE KNOWS NOT OF MERCY.
TO PRAY IS TO ACCEPT DEFEAT.
POWER PISSES ON THE WEAK.
BOW AND BEHEADED BY THE BEAST.
BEGGAR ON A BITCH'S LEASH.
SCUM IS DESPERATE FOR RELIEF.
WORSHIP IS THE WAY I RIDE.
WITCHING CURRENTS THROUGH THE EYE.
OF STORMS THAT FORCE THE FALSE TO DIE.
WORSHIP THE FLAMES WITH WHICH I RISE INTO APOCALYPTIC SKIES.
HARSH WINDS FLAY MINE FLESH TO BONE.
IN SPLINTERED SKELETON I ROAM.
WASTELANDS WITH NAUGHT TO CALL MY OWN.
BUT THE PATH I WALK ALONE.
THE HUNGER BURNS WITHIN MY GUT.
AS MY BONES TURN INTO DUST.
AND I KNOW SOON COME MY TIME.
FOR IN MINE VOID A PALE HORSE BURNS.
BUT I FEAR NOT THE TIME I'M TAKEN.
PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN.
WAGE WAR LIKE NO TOMORROW.
'CAUSE NO HELL, THERE WON'T BE ONE.
FOR ALL WHO DENY THE STRUGGLE.
THE TRIUMPHANT OVERCOME.
I CLOSE MY EYES AND SEIZE IT.
I CLENCH MY FISTS AND BEAT IT.
I LIGHT MY TORCH AND BURN IT.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
I CLOSE MY EYES AND SEIZE IT.
I CLENCH MY FISTS AND BEAT IT.
I LIGHT MY TORCH AND BURN IT.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.
I AM THE BEAST I WORSHIP.

AS FOR ME, I'M COOL WITH IT AND THAT'S ALRIGHT CAUSE IT'S MY THING.
WHAT IS IT? WHERE IS IT? HOW WILL IT AFFECT ME?
WORK THAT ANGLE 'TIL IT'S BEVELED, CURVE OF THE BLADE DOUBLED.
EDGE MADE TO BLEED THE STRUGGLE, BEST BELIEVE THE GAME'S A HUSTLE.
OBSERVER OF THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES, CONJURER OF THE SUBTLE.

BLEED IT ON THE DROP OF A DIME, DOWN TO POUND IT 'TIL IT SHINES.
MOONLIT LAKE OF BLOOD RED WINE, MAKE NO MISTAKE, I MAKES IT MINE.
BREAK SHIT DOWN AND MAKE IT GRIND TO THE GROOVE USED TO ALIGN.
THE CASCADING SHADES OF JADED BLUES WITH THESE RHYMES.
NUCLEAR STEEZE CREEPS AND WINDS.

LIFE SPENT IN CHAINS, SONIC LIVE WIRE.
ELECTRIFIED RAIN FROM THE LIPS OF THE DRIVER.
WHIPPIN' THE WHEEL.
FLIPPIN' DONUTS TO PEEL.

NEED IT TO KILL ONE MORE, AND CHILL WHILE I FEEL IT SO MUCH.
MY GUT BURNS LIKE THE TIRES.
MOVIN' THIS MOVEMENT OF REAL SHIT INSPIRED.
BY ALL THAT HAS COME BEFORE THIS AND WAS DONE.
FOR THE REAL ONES PACKIN' REAL GUNS LOADED WITH POWER.
SHOWER THE SLUMS WITH POWER FROM THE WAR.
MARCHING DRUMS THAT HAVE COME TO DEVOUR.
THE WEAKNESS THAT RUNS WHEN WE COME.
FUCKIN' COWARDS.

WHERE WAS I NOW?
LIKE I SAID BEFORE, HEAR SOMEONE KNOCKIN' AT MY FRONT DOOR.
WHO COULD IT BE?
SHOULD I IGNORE THE KNOCKIN' OR SEE WHAT COULD BE IN STORE FOR ME IF I LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THE SHORE?
SO MANY OPTIONS, SO LITTLE TIME.
TO DO WHAT I WANT 'FORE THE END OF THE LINE.
PLACES ITS BLADE IN THE SMALL OF MY SPINE.
