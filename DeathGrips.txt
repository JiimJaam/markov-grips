The weakness of this scene of fucks who lack the nuts to claim.
The streets from which that real shit comes to put you up on game.

Gutter rappin', anti-sleepin', no half-steppin'.
Low life creepin', high-def freakin' detonation.
Set it off, no hesitation, audio invasion.
But fuck that, can't thrust that to a beam, that shit had to go.
Machine that lick and let 'em blow like cream, black.
It's the magic host self-ream tactic.

Executors of that next shit.
Nest eye to the left shit.
That melt your face.
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless.
Death grips!
Bow down and take this what you get bitch.
Rest in bits as i pace up and down the low end of the bass.
Stomping rounds, automatic fire sounds in your face.
Rip them fakes out their flesh.
Come test this, get this straight, no escape.
Rigor mortis, dead weight.
Strung up and hung by hell-tensity drum.
Bitch slap negative space.
You thought that it makes through a cut.
That bit only info can create.
To properly uno, dos, trés.
Death grips.
Ride through your sk-sk-sk-skull.
Took hit to the face.
Dead weight off the hook, don't hate.
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place.
All night.
Triple x heat the rain in which we move.
While they choose to get used everyday.
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear.
Why you wish we were here.
While i say, get the fuck out my way.
Fit to get cut by fist gut if you stay.
Thought you was on top, but not no more.
That's right, whore, we're fucking you.
All right.
Fucking you.
Thought you knew we had shit locked to the beat street don't stop.
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot.

All night.
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row.
Give me the mic and step back, cuz.
Need to rip that, watch me bust.
Where you going? Not knowing till we get there.
Jack 'em off of it.
The sword what you're holding till you get well.
Have to hit 'em off with all you know and got that gold that make it cracked again.
Control this while i hold this enema death they set my casket in.
Growing like oceans, epileptic sex, can't get past this shit.
Spiraling too much, on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip.
What's up with that next shit?
It's death grips.
Illegal spit fire bum rushing you're tired as fuck.
Give it up, i'm here, look, don't touch why.
We're done and whip that, fuck you.

Death grips.
Nuclear fallout flesh and fire in the hole.
Death grips is some thrash, it goes right through your sk-sk-sk-skull.
Told you that i'm lightning.
Told you that i'm lightning.
Face melter.
Cock the barrel, trigger range.
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain.
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain.
Kaleidoscopic bullet train.
Never gave up, just a clutch.
Bitch.
Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust.
Dust to ashes, ash to mush.
Mashed off the madness man, combust.
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough.
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much.
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes.
Whirlpools i'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes.
Through this breaks the rules it takes.
But i not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase.
Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what i do with mine.
How to do impossible things.
How to do impossible things.
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream.
Madness.
Don't trip man, just know we come.
And won't even be close to done.
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face.
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop.
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
Why not?
Smash till i break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop.
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time.
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes.
Endorphins cashed by your own time.
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind.
Weed is of kind vaporize, freak man down from way this rides, how this rides.
Feet don't touch the ground inside, i twist the rhythm pounds 'em on.
How measurements of sound rewind.
Forever and a day forgot.
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank that hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe.
This takes the pain in shock.
Ahh!
Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what i do with mine.
How to do impossible things.
How to do impossible things.
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream.
Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock.
To the brains of heads that came to watch us claim the game haters can't knock us.
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face.
You can keep it, i don’t want it.
Back, my only inside pocket.
All up on it, man get off it.
Can’t you see me? Best to drop it.
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic.
How we fuck it off and rock it.
Paradox knot, disco sock it.
Can't unplug it with your logic.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
Fuck it.
And unplug it with your -
take out your eyes and watch it.
Make you cry, feel like i lost it.
Didn’t lose it, never had it.
Just another clueless faggot.
Bound and gagged by fear.
Too pathetic to be tragic.
Get that shit outta here.
Don’t know why you waste your time, just know what i do with mine.
How to do impossible things.
How to do impossible things.
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream.
I can’t deny i’ve not the slightest idea why.
Even attempt to try.
See them sigh.
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by.
Automatic supernova, so what? Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic.
We’ll storm in the gates, subatomic.
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face.
Helter skelter, face melter.
Helter skelter, face melter.
Helter skelter, face melter.
Helter skelter, face melter.
Helter skelter.
Hit it, split it, make it cum, get wetted.
Come again, come get it.
Seen it happening before it even happened.
Swing the door open and buck 'em down.
Course i'm just fuckin' around.
But nevermind the way it sound.
Everytime we make it pound.
Straight into the pavement now.
Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain.
Eat it, shit it out and change.
Lanes at speeds that seem insane.
To them petty pussy brains.
Push me and they will be slain.
Drag this past the point and claim.
That shit as if it was your name.
Like it's attached to yours with chains.
Own it till shit goes up in flames.
And there really ain't no one to blame.
No one to blame, its all the same.
Like blurred faces on subway trains.
Can't take it man, can't take the pain.
Pain of the game.
Makes me insane.
Makes me fuck up my whole thang.
Pain of the game.
Makes me insane.
Makes me fuck up my whole thang.
What'd you bring?
Where'd you get it?
Give it here, i said don't sweat it.

And i don't care if you give a shit.
Punk!
I'm gonna take it around for a bit.
And i don't care if you give a shit.
Punk! Bitch!
Goin' through the motions.
Just to make shit happen right.
Never knowin where we're goin'.
Just rollin' like waves at night.
Make it or break it, just dont sleep on it.
Sleepers get shot down, you lost it.
Trying to act like you got it.
Nevermind the way it sound.
Every time we make it pound.
Straight into the - sirens - ground.
Shot it up, get it hot, what.
I know you know you said too much.
Did too much, way too much.
Fuck that shit, man, that shit sucks.
Volume turned all the way up.
You already know it's going down.
I'll tell you when i've had enough.
Shut up right now.
Feel it in my gut right now.
Throw it up, give it up like.
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, blow!

Get up, get up.
All over the place, all in your face.
All up in it, talkin' 'bout can't wait.
To bring it even harder the next.
Time i creep through the beat possessed.
Howling on that mountain peak.
Feeling like hell's up in my chest.
Feel the fire rise, rise so high, so high i rise.
Eye to eye with death.
Gazing through me like an uzi.
Spraying through me, bag of flesh.
Body bag of flesh.
Ain't nothing left.
Toe tag me, zip the bag and check it.
Oh no, he's been resurrected.
Oh no, he's been resurrected.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
Zombie holocaust in seconds.
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.
From what we know, down deep inside.
Hell if i know, just wanna ride.
Until the wheels fall off and i.
Run off the road, no telling why.
Hear them cry:
Man, i just don't wanna die.
Just don't wanna, why.
Is everything always happening.
In the blink of eye?
This better be the last time me.
Ever see you in my life.
Steadily to the death passing.
Everything that don't seem tight.
Goin' through the motions.
Just to make shit happen right.
Never knowin' where we're goin.
Just rollin' like waves at night.

On the secrets i rely 'pon to freak this.
You can tell me what you said - go ahead.
But no sooner than you said it.
You can bet it was left for dead.
All you said in and out of my head in seconds.
Keep 'em guessin' endlessly.
Never let 'em know where you're headed.
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery.
How to show 'em they don’t mean shit to me.
Put 'em in their place, cause they ought to be.
Kept in the dark, not 'posed to see never, but only so much of me.
Double o.g. With a skeleton key.
Never meant a thing to me.
Effortlessly dead to me.
Check the sign no vacancy.
Extremely selective memory.

Thoughts that make you feel lost don’t doubt it.
You might just need it.
Already did that.
Can't never go back.
Yeah fuck that.
Gets the bozack.
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it.
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it.
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that.
You want it you can have it, no questions asked.
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don’t trip.
If you have one let a man know so i could flip a bitch and kill it.
Get it.
Head for the hills when it makes you feel.
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it.
Every time i get it to wind, 'round my finger and recline.
Behave or be slayed cause i will be damned if mine ever decays.
Forever on attack gut check the blind.
Game recognize game is tight.
Bow down or get banged for life.

Tak-kyon, tak-kyon.
Tak-kyon, tak-

Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull.

Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones.
Oh shit i'm feeling it - takyon.
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, i feel like killing it - takyon.
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - takyon.
Out of the blue, in through the back.
Door coming through like fuck, what was that?

How we creep without showing you jack.
Shit from below, give a shit if you know.
Cause even if you did, bet you’d keep coming back.
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat.
We make beats catch.
Beat it 'til it bleeds to death, each track.
Epileptic seize every head we crack.
Like epmd snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map.
Oh shit i'm feeling it - takyon.
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, i feel like killing it - takyon.
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - takyon.
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer.
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale 'til the whole chamber is clear.
Haters act so fucking weird.
Try to stain this atmosphere.
But they can't cause its way too sheer.
How to make a hater disappear.
Take shit where it ain’t never been.
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend.
This shit if i fisted your brain with it.
10, 9, 8, 7, triple six, five, forked tongue.
Criminal level crunk lightning storm.
Get out the way or get up torn.
Ain’t a picture big enough to fit.
What we dig up from the core.
Of all that they forgot ever was.
Militant march of this war.
Takyon - taking them down.
All we see is blood.
Takyon - turning them out.
How to trick out and freak that buzz.
Oh shit i'm feeling it - takyon.
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, i feel like killing it - takyon.
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - takyon.
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip.
Off the moonlit fire we spray.
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste.
So here’s the deal, if you don’t feel ill.
Don’t want it nowhere near my zone.
That shit is dead, can't nobody get.
With that shit gets dial toned.
Takyon - bitch slapping pussy clots and clones.
Takyon - setting off unabombs inside your dome.
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it.
Get with this or get left cause it's on!
Takyon.
Been workin' way too much need to get out and get fucked up.
What's going on? Where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see.
I need money, drugs, a ride.
And a spot with hot ones inside.
The mission:
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time.
I can do this and it's done.
Like that we're on our way.
Be it acid on the tongue.
Cocaine in your brain.
Or some weed that hits your lungs.
Like a runaway train.
Hell yeah, from dmt to mdma.
Got all that shit and more.
So till dawn we're okay, but anyway.
Fuck a line, every time.
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds.
All eyes on the dime.
That makes your dick want to grind.
Know you got a good buzz going.
Cause everything is glowing.
Skirt so short her ass is showing.
And she's looking so you’re knowing.
You could get it tonight.
But there’s so much around.
Best take your time, do it right.
As you keep getting higher.
Lights look like they're on fire.
Soon all that’s left of you.
Is your most primal desires.
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'.
Find a whore and it could happen.
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out.
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing.
I want it i, i need it, need it to make me feel heated.
Shake it, can't take it, must break it.
Break if off, yeah, what'd i say bitch?

Shake it, can't take it, must break it.
Break if off, yeah, what'd i say bitch?
Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself.
In the groove that has the whole party movin'.
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up.
And keep on riding cause your timing is on.
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone.
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on.
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks.
Start to pondering rape.
Me, i'm all about the face.
But it takes all kinds.
So pay no mind to the taste.
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass.
That makes their asses gyrate.
Forget to hydrate.
Till they're so fucked up they take.
Off all of their clothes and whip.
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips.
You got the ones on their grill.
Or between their hips.
But either way, i must say.
I really don't give a shit.
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell.
We could do this like an orgy.
In the bowels of hell.
Where every lucy’s hella horny.
And their pussies don't smell.

Responsibility's cool, but there’s more things in life.
Like getting your dick.
Rode all fucking night.
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight.
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice.
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice.
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like.
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright.
It's time to find one and take one.
Right now.
It's time to find one and make one say.
I'm down.
Think i just found one, 'bout to break one off.
Meanwhile.
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles.
May have gotten too fucked up cause i forgot how to smile.
Gonna have to do this shit jim morrison style.
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try.
First hot one i see with sex in her eyes.
Will be the hot one i need to take home with me tonight.
Wish me luck, give me dap.
And i'll talk to you later.

I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
And i know soon come my time.
For in mine void a pale horse burns.
But i fear not the time i'm taken.
Past the point of no return.
Wage war like no tomorrow.
'Cause no hell, there won't be one.
For all who deny the struggle.
The triumphant overcome.
Trips to where few have been.
Out of thin air, upon high winds.
Rites begin when the sun descends.
Have felt what few will ever know.
Have seen the truth beneath the glow.
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow.
I am below, so far below the bottom line.
Transmitting live, transmissions rise.
From the depths out of controlled by.
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes.
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds.
'Pon the path i find, and claim as mine.
To ride the waves of unrest.
Made to make me shine as a testament.
To why the ways of the blind will never get.
Shit but shanked by my disrespect.
Dismiss this life, worship death.
Cold blood night of serpent's breath.
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness.
In the bottomless wells of emptiness.
Channeled to invoke what we represent.
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power.
Riders of the lupus hour.
Eye on palm, time is gone.
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn.
Sacrifice to rise beyond.
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm.
In blood sworn to glorify and for life adorn.
With all that dies to become unborn.
I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
I am the beast i worship.
I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
I am the beast i worship.
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns.
Curve like psychotropic scythes.
And smell of torn flesh bled dry.
By hell swarms of pestis flies.
Vomiting forth flames lit by.
An older than ancient force.
That slays this life with no remorse.
The spiral storm of flames inside.
The torch i raise, the force i ride.
Feel my vessel go up in flames.
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed.
Direct connection to the source.
Vestment of unnatural force.
Forever burning black torch.
Wisdom of the old and true.
Possessed by the chosen few.
Shining to reveal the ways.
Of a darkness that pervades.
All that is and ever was.
Inferno of witches' blood.
Worship is not on bended knee.
Nature knows not of mercy.
To pray is to accept defeat.
Power pisses on the weak.
Bow and beheaded by the beast.
Beggar on a bitch's leash.
Scum is desperate for relief.
Worship is the way i ride.
Witching currents through the eye.
Of storms that force the false to die.
Worship the flames with which i rise into apocalyptic skies.
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone.
In splintered skeleton i roam.
Wastelands with naught to call my own.
But the path i walk alone.
The hunger burns within my gut.
As my bones turn into dust.
And i know soon come my time.
For in mine void a pale horse burns.
But i fear not the time i'm taken.
Past the point of no return.
Wage war like no tomorrow.
'Cause no hell, there won't be one.
For all who deny the struggle.
The triumphant overcome.
I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
I close my eyes and seize it.
I clench my fists and beat it.
I light my torch and burn it.
I am the beast i worship.
I am the beast i worship.
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Guillotine - yuh!
Sit in the dark and ponder how.
I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor.
And they all fall down - yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes - yuh!
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue.
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke.
Stomp music seriously - yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement.
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected.
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it.
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yuh! Yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Guillotine - yuh!
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech.
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat.
Causes my jaws to call out, out, out, out - yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads.
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge.
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yuh!
Tie the chord, kick the chair and you're dead - yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!
Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag.
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad.
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag - yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last - yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means.
To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yuh! Yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes.
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!
Tinted windows, bulletproof.
The slip knot fixing rope to noose.
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel.
The passion that blinds me so i feel - yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins.
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains.
And they all fall down - yuh!
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
I fuck the music, i make it cum.
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue.
Hit hit hit!
Want a beer? Have no fear, comes and goes, man it's here.
No one knows, feels so weird when it blows through my bones.
I got a jones for it, i wanna know more.
Cause it's 'bout what i got to show for it.
I want some more of it, i want too much.
I got so bored with it, i shot it up.
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up.
Yeah!
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, i need that shit's bound to be the death of me.
Fuck buying it i'm taking it and sharing it with nobody.
Cause all i really need is some cool shit to mob.
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job.
I own that shit, on some throw back shit, you already know that shit.
You even know 'bout how i know the man who grows that, biatch!
You can't buy it with your money, you can't find it overseas.
It's one of those things that seems outlandish 'til you have it's not a dream.
As for me, i'm cool with it and that's alright cause it's my thing.
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Work that angle 'til it's beveled, curve of the blade doubled.
Edge made to bleed the struggle, best believe the game's a hustle.
Observer of the strange occurrences, conjurer of the subtle.
Unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitch's bubble.
That’s right it’s all mine, never was yours.
Like how you wait in line while i walk straight through the door, straight through the-
hear you say something but ain't nothing, spectators ignored.
Pay no mind to that chump's just a player-hatin' whore.
I fuck the music, i make it cum.
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue.
Ain’t no fun if the aliens can't have none.
How i fuck it dirty, how i make it twitch and scream.
How it screams, oh, baby, hurt me. Work me to the bone. Oh, please.
How i bend the rhythm over and hit, hit, hit it on my knees.
Give, give, give it up, i need it all the time.
Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it 'til it shines.
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, i makes it mine.
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align.
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes.
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds.
Through secrets behind and between every time i scream:
Shit is mine! It's all mine!
All the time! Shit is mine!
What is it? Where is it? How will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, i need that shit.
Yeah.
Thought you knew, thought you thought, thought you did but did not.
Come on through; what you got? Is it cool? Is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop, i'm not through black blood clot.
In my view like that twat spread eagle 'cross the block.
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
Spread eagle 'cross the block.
Need no ego to rock.
What we know just gets dropped, how we keep shit on lock.
Cause all i really need is some cool shit to mob.
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job.
Shit is mine, it's all mine.
All the time, shit is mine.
Into the flame, into the fire.
With no regard for a thing.
Fuck that, i'm the lord of the game.
I rule this empire.
I am the god of hellfire!
Lord of the game.
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt.
'Cause no one has came even close to the train.
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower.
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher.
Than anything seen in your entire.
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire.
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver.
Whippin' the wheel.
Flippin' donuts to peel.
Out on the face of the base; where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more, and chill while i feel it so much.
My gut burns like the tires.
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired.
By all that has come before this and was done.
For the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power.
Shower the slums with power from the war.
Marching drums that have come to devour.
The weakness that runs when we come.
Fuckin' cowards.
When they tell you, you must take it.
And you think hell no!
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it.
Hits so low.
When they tell you, you must take it.
And you think hell no!

Lord of the game.
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt.
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought.
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower.
Which we maintain like soldiers of fame.
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Told me it was all good, but they lied.
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes.
Death to everyone who does not recognize.
War is never done, think it is you die.
Where was i now?
Like i said before, hear someone knockin' at my front door.
Who could it be?
Should i ignore the knockin' or see what could be in store for me if i leave the safety of the shore?
So many options, so little time.
To do what i want 'fore the end of the line.
Places its blade in the small of my spine.
Is it paranoia? Is it real?
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it.
And you don't wanna go.
When they tell you, you must take it.
And you think hell no!
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it.
Hits so low.
When they tell you, you must take it.

Rather be stuck naked.
Hits so low.
Than waste my time like the last time.
And every time before that.
Don't waste my time even one more time.
When you know that shit is whack.
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you.
Said you'd never go back.
Fuck where you're from.
Fuck where you're goin'.
It's all about where you're at.
Death.
It's death.
Move some.
Death.
It's death.
Move some.
It's death.
Move some.
Move.
Death.
Move some.
Move.
It's-

Move.
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs.
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain’t never done shit.
Stash what you got cause they're comin' through.
Best get rid of that quick.
Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do.
All they ever do is trip.
Minding my own business.
Minding my own business.
Minding my own business.
Minding my own business.
Try to hem me up like for life.
Stuck in the klink, haters in blue.
How they set me up? Should i test my luck?
Here they come, they're in pursuit.
What did i do? What haven't i done?
You want to see my i.d.? Umm...
Well, ok, where i'm coming from? Just on my way, not on the run.
What you want me to say? Are you just 'bout done?
Power trippin', asshole lickin' haters.
Notice how they strut through the spot.
Like anybody wants to see a cop.
Man, everybody knows they suck.
I got to be somewhere, man, fuck.
Why the hell you always stoppin' me.
Round the clockin' me, like what?
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs.
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain’t never done shit.
Stash what you got cause they're comin' through.
Best get rid of that quick.
Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do.
All they ever do is trip.
Six feet deep below the street.
So they can't never say shit again.
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick.
And put a black flag on the end.
Got to watch my back or just like that.
I’m bound to get locked up.
The law's watching me constantly.
Too close and way too much.
Looking over my shoulder.
And checking in the rear view mirror.
Cause i'm never not but a moment.
From getting taken to jail.
They're knocking at my door, down my door.
They're shining lights in my eyes.
Exactly what do they stand for?
Ever asking more of i, man, why?
Like it matters why i chose to ignore.
All the laws i've been told to abide.
Think i’m on parole, thinking i just stole.
Some shit, you got an a.p.b out on-
but no, you're wrong as usual.
Hell no, it wasn't me.
Have the nerve to ask me if i'm drunk.
When i’m pissing in the middle of the street.
Looking over my shoulder.
Looking over my shoulder.
Looking over my shoulder.
Looking over my-
by the way why they always acting.
Like they know how to size me up?
Ignorant bastards coming after me.
All the time on mine, had enough.
Why they always wanna hassle me?
Pigs all up on my nuts.
Like they have to be, like i can't see 'em.
Tryin' to play shade tree in the cuts.
By robbing me of my dignity.
So in the end, i never say much.
But ain’t a time pass i don’t wish i could flash.
On penelope like fuck.
Shot this for everyone who's been there.
For my real ones who understand.
What it feels like to have your rights read to you.
By the-
culture shock, future shock.
Fuck yourself, choke yourself.
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull.
You know what's going on every day, every night.
Everywhere, swear you're so international.
Upside down cross on the jumbotron.
Wait up, hold on.
Blowing anthrax off my palms.
Say what, you're wrong.
Switch stance, face plant.
Napalm fire starters.
Flatlander, plug puller.
Nose dive turbulence chartered.
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow.
You're the media's creation, yeah, your free will has been taken and you don't know.
Qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu.

She's a satanic priestess.
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist.
Crow on the down low end.
Reppin' orion's belt.
Atlantis ancient vagina.
Getting dusty on the shelf.
Enter the pigs don't get it.
No hands i'm shattering jaws.
Double nickles on the dime.
Fuck glam can lick my balls.
Culture shock, future shock.
Fuck yourself, choke yourself.
Whatchya gonna be when you're grown, young blood?
Gonna be a helpless drone.
Won't ever have to think.
No, your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone.
The virus is alive, i can see it in your eyes.
The infection is full blown.
Qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu.
Career killer, double-decker packed with suicidal brides.
Four-armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches' thighs.
Enters through unknowing eyes.
Touch the keys; it's in your mind.
Can't delete it and soon you'll find.
How bad you need it all the time.

Shiva slashin' through your flat screen.

Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide.
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons.
Vampire on the rise.
Punk a chump with a cunt for brains platoon.
In the zone and on the grind.
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks.
Catch and release.
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast.
Qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu.
Keep up or get left behind.
Qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu.

Why can't i just float through the walls? Through the walls.
Why can't i just float through the walls? Through the walls.
If you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mother ship.
Ugh! Yes, i like the drugs.
I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you.
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for.
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor.
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers.
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls.
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls.
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when i get to flashing, see the small.
Shrink to a fraction of what they're lacking and less than that in no time at all.
Can't believe they have the gaul to try and act.
Like they’re not trapped between these walls.
Bring it bring it.
Kill it.
Bring it, bring that shit heated.
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it.
Bring it, bring that shit heated.
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it.
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit.
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that.
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit.

Bring it, bring that shit heated.
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it.
Sometimes feel like i'm close but never get there, never get there.
Does it mean i'm a ghost if i'm still here? Wanna leave here.
And if i am why can't i just float through the walls? Through the walls.
And if i can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all.
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, i feel so bad.
Been there so long i can't remember who i am, or where i stand.
But in the end i guess i just don’t give a damn, twist a gram.
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man.
Judge you no more than i wish to be judged, even on the low.
But i do know what you do not speak of, don’t know but it shows.
Try to hide but i see who you are because i just know.
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go.
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood.
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood.

Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it.
See my blood spill drip, by chances.
Try to chill, quit, cause i can't just slip into a zagthoth trance.
Tongue hissing, serpent chants.
Come again work it in, yeah just like that.
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh.
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget.
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it.
Check it, bring it, kill it.
On everything i own, swear would rather slit my throat.
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope.
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke.
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before.
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane.
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark.
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart.
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop.
Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not.
Why can't i just float through the walls? Through the walls.

Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not.
Pass that shit.
Hold on man.
Park the car.
I have no idea where we are.
Think we may have drove too far.
Yeah i can see they're right behind us.
But there's nothing we can do.
We can't get caught slipping, get off that shit and just be cool.
They're on to us.
But don't look now.
They think they're 'bout to take us down.
Fuck that, i'm not going out.
Pass that shit.
At the next corner, turn left.
It's time to handle this.
Nowhere to go don't trip.
Have no time for that pussy sh-- agh.
In a minute it'll all be finished.
What you don't think i speak the truth.
You think i could just be sittin' here.
Listenin' to sonic youth.
Anywhere when they try to ride.
On you thinking i'm gone.
I'll creep up on 'em from behind.
And break 'em off one by one.
In the time it takes you to blink your eyes.
Shit'll already be done.
But just in case anything goes wrong.
Keep your right hand on your-
so when they step up out the car.
Yeah, i know this sounds bizarre.
But now i remember where we are.
Do what i say and you'll be fine.
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade.
Under the highway, digging graves.
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'.
Blood creepin'.
Shake the bottle what's it hold.
How many have i already sold.
Hope not too much cause i feel insane.
Need more than one to numb the pain.
Slithering through my brain.
Thoughts stuck on that train.
Off the track and up in flames.
Fuck it, i'll swallow these blue ones.
Yeah, and maybe this big one.
And i might as well take a few more with me just in case i get some.
I know you want 'em, yeah, no problem.
Got that covered, tramp, i brought 'em.
How it creeps up on me so slowly.
I don't notice my eyes rolling.
To the back of my head and falling.
Shit, somebody's calling.
Can't answer the phone.
Call 'em back when i'm 'bout to leave.
Can't think straight, man, i'm so fucking blown.
So when they step up out the car.
Yeah, i know this sounds bizarre.
But now i remember where we are.
Do what i say and you'll be fine.
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade.
Under the highway, digging graves.
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'.
Blood creepin'.
Down the alleys in the middle of the night.
I'm trashed, so high it's hard to ride my bike.
Might crash whenever i'm this fucked up.
Drunken monkey through the cuts.
Who gives a fuck?
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade.
Under the highway, digging graves.
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'.
Blood creepin.
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade.
Under the highway, digging graves.
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'.
Blood creepin'.
Get get get get got got got got.
Blood rush to my head bit hot lock.
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot.
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot.
Tailpipe draggin’, volume blastin’, bailin’ out my brain.
Red light flash, dem stop i smash.
Abraxas, hydroplane, massive.
Catch this flight flow rainin’ madness.
Mastered mine and laced.
The ave with black cat fish tailin’ waves of stratus.
Curb right to far left lane.
Don’t wait for me, if i care.
'Bout anything, anywhere.
Losin’ myself, i get the stares.
What i’m lookin’ at, wasn’t there.
Wasn’t there, wasn’t there.
Wasn’t there, wasn’t there.
Nothin’ out there, can’t stay inside.
Hit the bar, sleep deprived.
Who drove the car? I’m still alive.
Up in smoke, moon was low.
How’d you know, didn’t say i did.

Heavy thin air, sahara mascara smeared, end of an era.
Tracks on hera's peacock thighs, china white skies, ivory of my leper eyes.
Tone of sighs off nylon lips.
Where you runnin' now?
In fishnet wet guise of gimp horizon, slit bled like my wrist, i suck it dry like from the tit.
Which nipple's mine? Read the signs, still can't decide.
At your own risk at your own risk.
Don't touch me bitch! Don't touch me, bitch.
Where you runnin' now?
Accustomed to these satin glitches, drippin' from my casket's innards.
Charmer play me out the basket, last image i saw was splintered.
My reflection, i wasn't in it, in slow motion, i give in.

My star gate in a vacuum, monitor's eye view.
This valley is an urn, this valley i'm wadin' through.

I don't reply.
You been denied.
Sometimes i smile, sometimes i moan, sometimes i look away and nod.
Sometimes i give no reply and watch your ice break like a jaw.
Don't waste your breath, the time was over before it started.
When you arrived, i had already departed.
Now you know i'm-
walk on by.
Crashed and burned.
Forever rocking that worm.
Called the worm.
Just got high.
Klepto war hand on the ride.
Never answer when they hit me; why?
Never matter, pass on the lie.
'Bout what happens after we die.
Dust to ash, ashes to malt.
Ghost all black, control the zone.
The troll is threshed, i'm forced to ride.
Lock your door.
Argent clear.
All the dead is souls galore.
We just got spit in your eyes.
Rabid dogs off the leash.
From man to man as we beef.
Get the fuck out of that jeep.
All hell leave i lead the sting.
Now you know i'm ready

From the dogs who want more beef.
For the law, code of the streets.

reload the barrel and creep like a wolf among sheep.
See how we bum-rush the weak.
Brush them guts with our feet.
Can't knock the asphalt, coded mystique.
Crack the code, unlock the vault, make off with all that we seek.
It's death, death, death.
Blalala-lack... Mist.
Mister who you rise to picket pick it big dick, big dick.
Rise the gutter to the surface, never did, never did.
Liked to wonder why the shoot end of the ache.
I get lost in the shutter of the view.
Click click, freeze frame in the floor.
Hit the ceiling like a brick, fired up.
Every day, every day, every night, every night.
Every day giving less of a shit from the side.
Through the eye of a shadow.
That's what's this, fired up.
I'm so high, told rigor mortis grips, fired up.
To the sky and out the sky.
Where is it, where the fuck is it and why.
Did it happen like this, fired up.
Told ride through the sky of black mist.
Two, three, four, five.
We must die, this is it, fired up.
Zero the sleazy.
We forget that you control how that go drink gallon .
At the speed of wrist to read through chose me push to turn.
Through his soul to wear yellow to funerals, fired up.
Magic coffin all his end of the way let go.
Like a high that keeps me low.
Oh yeah yeah why.
Are you sure that it's tonight.
Cause if it's not i might get got.
The complication of your system.
Unexpected, don't wanna be the victim.
More than the fairy.

I rise, i fall, i roll again.
I have no age, i don't pretend i'm here.
My absence stains me sketch gets weird.
I thrive on empty.
Can't predict me with them petty, such a pity.
My peak keeps rising, they keep sinking.
Into lakes they're crying, i keep spitting.
Wish i could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty.
Tilt your lump, till back of your brains 'tween your weak slumped shoulder blades.
Still can't scope peak i pave into one-way street to space.
Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek.
This world of cattle at my feet, born to get put back to sleep.
At my feet, born to get put back to sleep.

I crash on bed of nails, in my frail suit of scabs i relax.
While having seizures in my shack.
I take no breather, i took the pact.
I grind this stone into my path.
I wait for you in this disguise.
Remorselessly beyond alive.

Fuck the sun, fuck its kind.
Daylight sucks, waste of mine.
I fuck my mind, narrow my mind.
I bide my time like fuck in place.
One day, i'll wave sun to ice.
Watch its kind get thrown like rice.
My cackle stretch out like thunder.
So fucking loud, it's vulgar.
I pull my face out the dirt slow.
These days i only wake up third of the way, narco.
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold.
These days i recede, rapid i reload.
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left to travel.
I know what this calls for.
Where's my scalpel? Operation cut.
Like i'm bored, sew my inner war up like corn rows.
My internal war blows, like freezing fog in oslo.
Frozen, i can't get soft, baptized in hoarfrost.
Like carbon monoxide garage.
Freeze your blink like sandman's flush.
I hate you so much.
I hate your laws.
I hate your need a cause.
I hate your faux touch.
I hate every last one of you.
I ponder digesting razors, just to be done with you.
I love you so much.
I'm triple the motherfucker.
Mondo-fisted, full of backwards.
From banana town manor.
My slang step like legless lizard.
I fuck around, fashion a rocket.
Shoot to mercury, for the winter.
Extended vacation till i decompose on my splinters.
I pull my face out the dirt slow.
These days i only wake up third of the way, narco.
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold.
These days i recede, rapid i reload.
Gun my chances, closed road, no road left.
To centuries of damn.
I've never been so yawn.
Can't believe i'm still standing.
Can't believe life take this long.
I stagger off to find my lighter.
I don't return until the day sag a* validates.
Mankind's destiny in a worm.
By the way, i don't pet bleachers.
Court side to nose bleeders.
Like i shoot shit with gimps.
No response, lose 'em once.
Incoming second attempt.
To be real, i just shoot 'em up just shoot 'em up
them clueless strut nailed to crucifix lilith shoved up her cunt shoved up her cunt
fuck.

All fuck life wasn't what it is.
All fuck life was just a bridge.
I seen some free landed some tricks.
Far i see high time man quit.
Won't let you know when i get going.
Phone ring too long.

Noticed me, i've never seen you.
Wonder what the fuck i do.
Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close.
My most recent purchase, old black rope.
Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber.
Perfect reminder, occult i'm made of.
Come try it out whenever you wanna.
Last night, 3:30 in the morning, death on my front porch.
Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death.
Fuck you waiting for.
Like a question no one mention.
He turns around, hands me his weapon.
He slurs, use at your own discretion, it's been a pleasure, stefan.
Head on like dead, on like grey.
Death in your way, not in my way, i got my way.
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way.
I'm on one like bae, you're on your way, way, way, way.

Phone ring too long.
Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal.
I'm in no weary, my vital post dated.
But clearly been ages since life had appeal.
Far more than fascination.
My second nature chant kill cause i can.
This body by my own hands.
My friends and family won't understand.
So i stay in the end, don't make none to me.
If it wasn't for them, i'd make that decision.
On gp.
Had to do it all again, i'd make that decision.
On gp.
All the nights i don't die for you.
Wouldn't believe how many nights i ain't died for you.
On gp.
Not that i care, i'd be a liar.
If i sat here claiming i'd exit in a minute.
But i can't say i wouldn't, i have my limits.

I skid like rita lifted ocean.
I drift like my planet don’t spin.
I skid all over marks like i’m haunted.
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits.
It’s never much, i’m war torn in the cockpit.
Don’t interrupt, my turbulence slaps.
My path massive demands panoramic.
Massive.
Shitty, you’re ten thousand leagues subzero, sweat dripping.
My hancock do-rag riptides like tent city.
Standoff through low lands eerie silencing.
Greed tastes like sin.
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes.
Spikes are pulling, are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull-
spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes.
Peel out, press me to magnetic slab.
Severe swerving i tow lag.
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks.
My salvia silhouette commence shots.
Sixty shots a second on a hexed clock.
I strike ‘tween each time your solar plex drops.
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes.
I’m skidding out.
I can’t help yourself, i skid in doubt.
I’ve dealt with yourself, i tricked hell out.
I’m all helter skelter, i’m on that faust.
None of me left but reflex skidding out.
Pulse in my chest feel like it’s fixing to bounce.
Bounce, bitch, i can’t be the road.
I’m crashing into planes, i crash and stroll.
Maxed out my oath.
Don’t blame me, i’ve no soul.
Greed tastes like sin.
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes.
Spikes are pulling, are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull-

Tall knives in my grill feel potent.
My jigsaw manipulates you open.
My skids writ rubbernecks agent orange.
I skid like i’m no use.
My headband expand like i choose juice.
I binge, all black enhance my tragic.
Ends to a means i can’t establish.
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice.
Cumulus in both hands, can’t kill myself twice.
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies.
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies.
I’m too passcode, these gates won’t stay closed.
Control gets old, i smash out my skin.
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind.
I’m finally astral now, grab my stems.
Greed tastes like sin.

Mass execution, rapid improvements.
Toothless accent, drawl of a shaman.
Putrid fanatic ride out like famine.

Braided fumigation, destitution ramped.
Desiccated satyr make a massacre dance.

Psychotropic steel trap, rock a beat up bears hat.
Naw man, i don’t feel this and i shit on your guilt trip.
Then extinguish your illness like seven grams of thorazine.
Tyrannic authority cleansed by your aggressor.
Inhuman elitist decline your surrender.
Sign of the freak thriving on a bender.
Forbidden discipline, all lines disconnected.
Vacated premises occupied by my death wish.

Compulsion on risers, your stranglers knuckles.
Your temples buckle.
Decompression silo inside this muzzle.
Overdriven rituals on my torso, my infernal boro.
If i went soft glock to my navel.

She’s wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild.
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out.
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style.
Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows.
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow.
Trembling young wounded mammal.
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel choke
jack slide leave atlantic puddles.
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles.
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto.
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco choke
low res mega evil patina.
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver.
Infamous nature in rags like reaper.
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers.
Lovely, lovely, they’re so blonde.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
Dusty, dusty, so far gone.
I’m fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
It’s ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on.
These knives bleed knives.
They cut me, i’ll cut you.
Below is above you.
Above is below me.
I’m dying to try on these knives.
You don’t know me.
Dilemma.
Dilemma.
Thingany thingany, so jinx now.
She’s wahwah wah-wah-wah-wild.
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out.
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style.
Little richard took a picture.
He got triggered by the click'a.
He got beat up, he got bigger.
Little richard, little richard.
Little richard, he's in the dorms.
He's gonna bomb and look good when he bombs, in the dorms.
Maria sharapova, yes, as good as anyone's guess.
Little richard, little richard.
He just needs to a, b, c, and d.
He just needs the world to be what he has seen.
In the horn section, they hide weapons.
Bottom of a white bic, chewed up like a pig's dick.
Little richard, little richard.
The fear jump, jump, jump
i'm gonna kill somebody jump, jump, jump
don't jump!
Downs you with dull pain, won't we become strange?
Tied up with your legs, hide helps, on the way.
Who will help you fall? It's just all so frail.
So long since we fell, still don't know we failed.
Go for the most tears, stay cause it gets strange.
Went there to shed years, left there in lead chains.
Been there since next year, scarred us to death chair.
Scared us to rest less, skull full of house guests.
The fear.
The fear.
I feel so sick today i'm afraid to be here with you
you wanna kill somebody i'm afraid to be here with you
i feel so sick today i'm afraid to be here with you
you wanna kill somebody i'm afraid to be here with you
don't jump! Jump, jump, jump
jump, jump, jump
the fear.
Pulled close by its pliers, cold, sharp, and expired.
Like ribs of vampire, like winds on high wire.
Whips you like it cares, push you down more stairs.
Kicks you for quick laughs, don't cry, you won't last the fear
missing entire weeks, months gone as i peak.
Lost tongue, mystery, everyone's on to me the fear
who's this stole my heels, stumbled into hell.
Hates me till it heals, wakes me with the chills the fear
i feel so sick today i'm afraid to be here with you
you wanna kill somebody i'm afraid to be here with you
i feel so sick today i'm afraid to be here with you
you wanna kill somebody i'm afraid to be here with you
frightening and embarrassing.
Like one percent and pleasantries.
Gather your things bolt till you reach.
The crystal fields of ketamine.
I'll meet you there, i'll beat you there.
Bet i'll be there before you leave.
Time you get there i’ll be midair.
Like peace of mind's a bore to me.
The fear, the fear.
Jump, jump.
Don't jump!
When the rail holds you, flight like stairs grows you.
Off your mind must wish, this is not my ditch.
Ah that ditch wears you, host torn and worn through.
Hard looks at blank walls, held way too long pause.
The fear, the fear.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Called shots, cheap shots, slack jaws, low blows.
Weak chins, chin checked, chin up like cholos.
No life signs left, ah, yes, try mine.
This thresh hold thresh, hold stretch, life times.
Machine, human, malformed machine.
Uninformed unit, forlorn regime.
Metamorph me into done for at last.
At least until my present shore has passed.
Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?
Why me?!
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Nut job, no job, fuck jobs, not hired.
Low lands, road rash, war path, crossfire.
Nonthreats, hot mess, known threats, stalk less.
Talk less, show less, snatch yours trap doors.
Ripper, ripper, skin tight, too tight.
Too tight, holding solid, moonlight, moonlight.
Moonlight, kevlar coated slit moon, lunar gush.
Lunar gush, carry on carrion never been far enough.
Hocus breaking in and centering.
Broke in and gave up on everything, everything.
Why me?!
Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Wah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, di-dah, disappointed.
Rot clot, corpse clutch, corpse clot, your husk.
Scorned husk, born shook, torn trick, core breached.
Shook, fuck, shit head, bitch, too short street.
Shut, fuck up or fed, both, you're-
disappointed.
